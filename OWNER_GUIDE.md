# Owner User Guide - How to See Your Data

## 💡 **Common Questions**

### **Q: Why can't I see "Tenant 1" or "abbas"?**
**A:** These are orphan records (no owner). Only admin can see them. This is for security.

### **Q: I created a tenant but can't see them?**
**A:** Make sure you:
1. Assigned the tenant to an apartment in YOUR building, OR
2. Created the tenant directly (it will show in your tenant list)

### **Q: Why is my tenant list empty?**
**A:** You need to either:
1. Create tenants and assign them to apartments in your buildings, OR
2. Create tenants directly without building assignment

### **Q: Can I see other owners' data?**
**A:** No, this is by design for security and privacy. Each owner has their own isolated environment.
